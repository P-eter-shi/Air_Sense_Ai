                                  üåç Tackling Air Pollution with Predictive Analytics: A Smart Solution for Clean Air (SDG 3 & 11)
Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental health threats globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
over 7 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality.
Major pollutants such as CO, NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5, and PM10 contribute to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature deaths, especially in urban areas.

This problem directly relates to:
    SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being
    SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Despite numerous monitoring stations, real-time prediction and warning systems are lacking in many cities, especially in developing regions. Citizens often remain unaware of upcoming air quality changes until it's too late.
                                   üí°Solution: AirSense AI
AirSense AI is a machine learning-powered system that:
    Collects real-time air quality data (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, PM2.5, PM10, AQI)
    Predicts upcoming pollution events
    Notifies communities in advance, helping them take protective measures.
I trained a model using historical air quality data and built a system that classifies future readings as ‚ÄúPolluted‚Äù or ‚ÄúNon-Polluted‚Äù with high accuracy. It provides:
                                  üöÄ How It Works:
    Data Collection: Hourly air quality readings from cities (e.g., Brasilia)
    Labeling: Data is labeled based on pollution thresholds (e.g., WHO guidelines)
    Model Training: A classifier (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression) learns to detect polluted conditions
    Prediction: The system predicts whether upcoming readings will be hazardous
    Notification: Citizens and environmental bodies are alerted in real-time
